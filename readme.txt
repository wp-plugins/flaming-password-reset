This plugin was created to help with user management, giving admins a quick and easy way to reset user's passwords.

== Description ==

    This is a really simple plugin that has saved us a lot of time and effort for a task I tend to have to repeat often. I know I could forward my users onto the forgotten password page but we believe in great customer service, so we built a plugin to make this an easy process!

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Install the plugin via the Plugin >> Add Plugins on you admin dashboard. 
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Your ready to go!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where do I reset the password? =

Go into the "Users" section and mouse over the user to reveal the Edit, Delete, and now the "Reset Password" option!

== Screenshots ==

1. The settings page allows you to customize the emails going out to your users. This page showcases some shortcodes.
2. To initiate a password reset go to the User tab and mouse over the user.
3. You can see below that after clicking "Reset Password" you see a short profile card including avatar, username, and email address. Also you can see we automatically generate a password for your user, however you can specify another password instead, but don’t forget to click "Reset Password" to apply those changes!
4. You should then see one of two messages; "Successfully changed the users password and sent them an email." which is obvious, or you may also see an error message. This typically means that you’ll need to setup an SMTP server.
